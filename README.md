##General Erlang-coded Reinforcement-Learning paradigm for Machine Learning [THESIS]

###APROACH
Erlang-coded general learning system. With this system, we push forward the idea of machine learning systems for which the operators can be modified and finetuned for each problem. This allows us to propose a learning paradigm where users can write (or adapt) their operators, according to the problem, data representation and the way the information should be navigated. To achieve this goal, data instances, background knowledge, rules, programs and operators are all written in the same functional language, Erlang. Since changing operators affect how the search space needs to be explored, heuristics are learnt as a result of a decision process based on reinforcement learning where each action is defined as a choice of operator and rule. As a result, the architecture can be seen as a "system for writing machine learning systems" or to explore new operators.
